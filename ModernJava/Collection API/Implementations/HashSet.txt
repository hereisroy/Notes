Underlying Data Structure: Hash table
Ordering: Unordered (no guaranteed order of elements)
Performance: Time complexity for add, remove, contains - O(1) on average
Null elements: Allows one null element
Use Case: When you donâ€™t care about the order of elements and need fast lookups and insertions.
