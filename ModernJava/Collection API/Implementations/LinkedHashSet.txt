Unlike HashSet, which does not guarantee any specific order, LinkedHashSet maintains the order in which elements were inserted
Internally, LinkedHashSet uses a doubly-linked list to maintain the insertion order of the elements.
Maintains the insertion order while offering constant time operations, but with more memory overhead than HashSet


public class LinkedHashSet<E>
    extends HashSet<E>
    implements Set<E>, Cloneable, java.io.Serializable
	
Below are the extra methods (Not present in HashSet Class) in this class

Constructors :
LinkedHashSet() - Constructs a new, empty linked hash set with the default initial capacity (16) and load factor (0.75)
LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity)
LinkedHashSet(int initialCapacity, float loadFactor)
LinkedHashSet(Collection<? extends E> c)
